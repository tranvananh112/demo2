# Face API Models Directory

This directory should contain the Face API models for face recognition.
Due to file size limitations, the models are not included in this repository.

To use face recognition features, you need to download the models from:

Required models:
- tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json

- face_landmark_68_model-shard1
- face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_recognition_model-shard1

Place these files in the /public/models/ directory.
